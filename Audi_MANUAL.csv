2016,Audi,A3 / S3,PDF,2016 Audi A3 / S3 — Owner's Manual,"If you plan to tow a trailer, please remember that the additional load will affect durability, economy and performance. Trailer towing not only places more stress on the vehicle, it also calls for more concentration from the driver. For this reason, always follow the operating and driving instructions provided and use common sense. Use a weight-carrying hitch conforming to the gross trailer weight.

The hitch must be suitable for your vehicle and trailer and must be mounted securely on the vehicle's chassis at a technically sound location. Use only a trailer hitch with a removable ball mount. Always check with the trailer hitch manufacturer to make sure that you are using the correct hitch. Do not use a bumper hitch.

The hitch must be installed in such a way that it does not interfere with the impact -absorbing bumper system. No modifications should be made to the vehicle exhaust and brake systems. From time to time, check that all hitch mounting bolts remain securely fastened. When you are not towing a trailer, remove the trailer hitch ball mount.

This prevents the hitch from causing damage should your vehicle be struck from behind. If your trailer is equipped with a braking system, check to be sure that it conforms to all regulations. The trailer hydraulic brake system must not be directly connected to the vehicle's hydraulic brake system.",https://ownersmanuals2.com/d/71175

If you cannot sit more than 10 inches (25 cm) from the steering wheel, see if adaptive equipment is available to help you reach the pedals and increase the distance from the steering wheel. For detailed information on how to adjust the driver's seat, see page 63, Power seat adjustment. The steering wheel can be adjusted even when the ignition is turned off.

To lock the steering after you have removed the ignition key, turn the steering wheel in either direction until you hear it lock into place. You should always lock the steering whenever you leave your vehicle. This makes a vehicle theft even more difficult. If it is difficult to turn the key after you have inserted it into the ignition lock, turn the steering wheel back and forth.

This will take the load off the steering lock mechanism and you will be able to turn the key freely and start the engine. On vehicles with a diesel engine*, the system can preheat in this position. Starting the engine. In this position, the engine starts.

To help the filter from being clogged by wax, the fuel filter in your vehicle is automatically preheated. Preheating the fuel filter makes operation of your vehicle possible with Diesel fuel No. 2 down to - 10° F (-24° C). If you expect temperatures below 5° F (-15° C) ask your fuel dealer whether their Diesel fuel No. 2 is sufficiently winterized for the prevailing and expected temperatures.

If not winterized or insufficiently winterized diesel fuel has already thickened to the extent that the engine will not start, warm the vehicle up by leaving it in a heated garage. It is normal that the engine noise level (dieseling) is louder during the warm-up period in winter. It is also normal when whitish -blue smoke comes out of the tailpipe after starting and during warm-up. The amount of smoke depends on the outside temperature.

Do not let your diesel engine idle unnecessarily after a cold start. Driving off slowly will shorten the warm-up period.",https://ownersmanuals2.com/d/71867

If you keep the lever pressed down, you will alter your speed in 5 mph 10 km/hl increments. You can also press the accelerator pedal down to increase your speed, e.g. if you want to pass someone.

The speed you saved earlier will resume as soon as you release the accelerator pedal. If, however, you exceed your saved speed by 5 mph (10 km/h) for longer than 5 minutes, the cruise control will turn off temporarily. The symbol will go out but the saved speed will be retained. Vehicles with manual transmission: You can attain the set speed only if the currently engaged gear allows it and the engine is not stressed.

Shifting to a higher or lower gear promptly will allow the engine to run smoothly. The cruise control cannot maintain a constant speed when driving downhill. The vehicle will accelerate under its own weight. Downshift to a lower gear or use the brakes to slow down.

Your vehicle is equipped with a S tronic transmission, also called a double-clutch system/transmission. Power is transferred between the engine and the transmission by means of two independent clutches. They replace the torque converter of conventional automatic transmissions and allow the vehicle to accelerate without a noticeable break in the power flow. With the aid of Tiptronic, the gears can optionally be shifted manually (page 118).",https://ownersmanuals2.com/d/71856

The climate controls are a combination of heating, ventilation and cooling systems, which automatically reduce humidity and cool the air inside your vehicle. The air temperature, air flow, and air distribution are automatically regulated to achieve and maintain the desired passenger compartment temperature as quickly as possible.

The system automatically compensates for changes in the outside temperature and for the intensity of the sunlight entering the vehicle. We recommend you use the Automatic mode (page 101) for year-round comfort. When the outside temperature is high and the air is very humid, condensation from the evaporator may drip under the vehicle. This is normal and does not indicate a leak.

If the outside temperature is low, the fan normally only switches to a higher speed once the engine coolant has warmed up sufficiently. The air conditioner temporarily switches off when you drive off from a standstill using full throttle to save engine power. The compressor also switches off if the coolant temperature is too high so that the engine can be adequate ly cooled under extreme loads.

At higher speeds, the lock in the N position is automatically switched off. The selector lever is not locked when rapid shifts are made through the N position (e.g. from R to D). This allows you to ""rock"" the vehicle if it becomes stuck.

If the lever is in the N position for more than 1 second with the brake pedal not depressed, the selector lock engages automatically. The release button in the selector lever handles prevents accidental shifts into certain selector lever positions. When you press the release button, the selector lever lock is cancel led. In the illustration, the positions in which the release button has to be pressed are highlighted in color - page 145, fig. 139.

Switching to manual can be carried out with the vehicle stationary as well as moving. When accelerating, the transmission shifts into the next gear in gears 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 shortly before the maximum permissible engine speed is reached. The selector paddles on the steering wheel are activated when the selector lever on the center console is in D, S, or in the manual position (Tiptronic mode). You can also shift gears in the Tiptronic mode using the selector lever on the center console.

In the event of system malfunctions, the automatic transmission switches to the fail-safe mode. This is signaled by one segment or all the segments in the display illuminating or going out.

These roof racks are the basis for a complete roof rack system. Additional attachments/carrier systems are necessary to transport luggage and sports equipment. The permissible roof load for your vehicle is 165 lb (7 5 kg).

The roof load is the total of the weight of the roof rack, the attachments and the cargo you are carrying. However, you must also note the permitted load of the carrier system being used. The permitted axle load and the permitted total vehicle weight. A new vehicle must be broken in for the first 1,000 miles (1,500 km).

Do not drive at speeds that will exceed 2/3 of the maximum permitted engine speed (RPM) for the first 600 miles (1,000 km), and avoid full acceleration during this period. You may gradually start increasing the RPM and the speed between 600 miles (1,000 km) and 1,000 miles (1,500 km). During the first hours of use, the engine has a higher internal friction than later on when all moving parts have settled into place with each other. How the vehicle is driven during the first 1,000 miles (1,500 km) also affects the engine quality.

Drive at moderate engine speeds after the initial break-in period, particularly when running a cold engine. This will reduce engine wear and improve the mileage. Do not drive at too low of an engine speed (RPM). Shift down if the engine stops running ""smoothly"".

Extremely high engine speeds are automatically reduced. The amount of fuel consumption, the environmental impact and the wear to the engine, brakes, and tires depends mostly on your driving style. With an anticipatory and economic driving style, fuel consumption can be reduced by approximately 10-15%.

Predictive messages appear in the instrument cluster display to show the driver the appropriate time to coast when a situation ahead requires you to drive at a lower speed. The messages are only shown if the cruise control system* or adaptive cruise control* is switched off.

The adaptive cruise control system is a combination of speed and distance regulation. It assists the driver by both regulating the speed and maintaining a distance to the vehicle driving ahead, within the limits of the system.

Depending on the mode, the engine and the automatic transmission respond quicker or in a more balanced manner to an accelerator pedal movements. In the sporty-dynamic mode, the automatic transmission shifts at higher RPMs. The steering adapts in terms of steering effort and steering ratios.

Indirect steering that moves easily, like the steering in comfort mode, is best suited to long drives on a highway. In contrast, dynamic mode provides sporty, direct steering. The follow ing applies to vehicles with dynamic steering*: the steering ratio changes based on vehicle speed in order to maintain optimum steering effort for the driver at all times. This sets the steering to be less sensitive at higher speeds in order to provide improved vehicle control.

At reduced speeds, however, steering is more direct in order to keep the steering effort as minimal as possible when the driver is maneuvering the vehicle. At low and average speeds, dynamic steering additionally provides more responsive steering performance. The adaptive dampers* use sensors to record information regarding steering movements, braking and acceleration operations by the driver, road surface, driving speed, and load.

If the windshield wiper lever is in the interval wipe position with the ign it ion switched off, the rain sensor is not activated until vehicle speed is above 4 mph (6 km/h). To reduce the sensitivity of the rain sensor, the switch A must be moved down.

To increase the sensitivity of the rain sensor, the switch must be moved up. The higher the sensitivity setting, the sooner the windshield wipers react to moisture on the windshield. Increased sensitivity is signaled by the windshield wipers making a single pass over the windshield. The rain sensor wiper intervals depend on the sensitivity setting as well as vehicle speed.

During brief stops, wiper motion will adjust in relation to the amount of rain on the windshield. Always check that the wiper blades are not frozen to the glass before you turn the wipers on. Loosen a wiper blade which is frozen in place before operating the wipers to prevent damage to the wiper blade or the wiper motor. Do not use the wipers to clear a frosted window.

Using the wipers as a convenient ice scraper will destroy the wiper blades. Before you take your vehicle to an automatic car wash, make sure you have the windshield wiper system switched off (lever in position 0), otherwise the windshield wiper system could get damaged in the car wash if it should suddenly come on.",https://ownersmanuals2.com/d/71210

2015,Audi,A8 / S8,PDF,2015 Audi A8 / S8 — Owner's Manual,"In order to provide effective lubrication and cooling of internal engine components, all internal combustion engines consume a certain amount of oil. Oil consumption varies from engine to engine and may change significantly over the life of the engine. Typically, engines with a specified break-in period (see ¢ page 205) consume more oil during the break-in period than they consume after oil consumption has stabilized. Under normal conditions, the rate of oil consumption depends on the quality and viscosity of the oil, the RPM (revolutions per minute) at which the engine is operated, the ambient temperature and road conditions.

Further factors are the amount of oil dilution from water condensation or fuel residue and the oxidation level of the oil. As any engine is subject to wear as mileage builds up, the oil consumption may increase over time until replacement of worn components may become necessary. With all these variables coming into play, no standard rate of oil consumption can be established or specified. There is no alternative to regular and frequent checking of the oil level, see Note.

When a vehicle with a conventional energy system is not driven for a long time, the battery is drained by equipment (for example the immobilizer). In certain circumstances, there could may not be enough energy to start the engine. Your vehicle is equipped with an intelligent energy management system for distributing electricity.

This significantly improves the starting ability and increases the battery life. The energy management system Is made up of batt ery diagnosis, idling current management and dynamic energy management. The battery diagnosis determines the battery charge level. The sensors determine the battery voltage, the battery current, and the battery temperature.

The current charge level and the performance of the battery are determined based on this. The idling current management decreases the energy used while parked. With the engine switched off, it manages the energy distribution to the different electrical components. Date from battery diagnosis is taken into account for this.

Depending on the battery charge level, electrical equipment is switched off one item after the other, to prevent the battery from draining and to retain the starting ability. While driving, dynam ic ene rgy management dist ributes the appropriate amount of energy to the electrical equipment. It controls the battery charge level so that more energy is not used then is being generated in order to maintain an optimal battery charge level.

2015,Audi,RS5 Coupe,PDF,2015 Audi RS5 Coupe — Owner's Manual,"Speed warning system. The speed warning system helps you to keep your driving speed below a set speed limit. The speed warning system warns if the driver exceeds a previously stored maximum speed. A warning tone will sound as soon as the vehicle speed exceeds the set speed by about 3 mph (3 km/h).

At the same time, a warning symbol appears in the display. The symbol's appearance might be different in some models. The speed warn ing system has two warning thresholds that function independently of each other and that have somewhat different purposes: Speed warning 1. You can use speed warning 1 to set the maximum speed while you are driving.

This setting will remain in effect until you turn off the ignition, assuming that you have not changed or reset the setting. The speed warning symbol in the warning 1 display appears when you exceed the maximum speed. It goes out when the speed falls below the stored maximum speed. The speed warning symbol will also go out if the speed exceeds the stored maximum speed by more than about 25 mph (40 km/h) for at least 10 seconds.

The stored maximum speed is deleted. Storing warning 2 is recommended if you always want to be reminded of a certain speed, for example when you are traveling in a country that has a general maximum speed limit, or if you do not want to exceed a specified speed for winter tires.",https://ownersmanuals2.com/d/71945

2017,Audi,TT / TTS Coupe,PDF,2017 Audi TT / TTS Coupe — Owner's Manual,"Your car is factory-equipped with low aspect ratio tires. These tires have been thoroughly tested and been selected specifically for your model for their superb performance, road feel and handling under a variety of driving conditions. The low aspect ratio of these tires is indicated by a numeral of 55 or less in the tire's size designation. The numeral represents the ratio of the tire's sidewall height in relation to its tread width expressed in percentage.

Conventional tires have a height/width ratio of 60 or more. Low aspect ratio tires can be damaged more easily by impact with potholes, curbs, gullies or ridges on the road, particularly if the tire is underinflated. In order to minimize the occurrence of impact damage to the tires of your vehicle, we recommend that you observe the following precautions: These tires may wear more quickly than others. Please also remember that, while these tires deliver responsive handling, they may ride less comfortably and make more noise than other choices.",https://ownersmanuals2.com/d/72015

2009,Audi,TT / TTS Coupe,PDF,2009 Audi TT / TTS Coupe — Owner's Manual,"Tires and vehicle load limits: There are limits to the amount of load or weight that any vehicle and any tire can carry. A vehicle that is overloaded will not handle well and is more difficult to stop. Overloading cannot only lead to loss of vehicle control but can also damage important parts of the vehicle and can lead to sudden tire failure, including a blowout and sudden deflation that can cause the vehicle to crash. Your safety and that of your passengers also depends on making sure that load limits are not exceeded.

Vehicle load includes everybody and everything in and on the vehicle. These loa d limits are technica lly referred to as the vehicle's Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (""GVWR""). The ""GVWR"" includes the weight of the basic vehicle, all factory installed accessories, a full tank of fuel, oil, coolant and other fluids plus maximum load. The maximum load includes the num ber of passenger s that the vehicle is intende d to carry (""seating capacity"") with an assumed weight of 150 lbs (68 kg) for each passenger at a designated seating position and the total weight of any luggage in the vehicle.

The Gross Axle Weight Rating is the maximum load that can be applied at each of the vehicle's two axles. The Gross Vehicle Weight Rating and the Gross Axle Weight Rating are listed on the safety compliance sticker label located on the driver's side B-pillar. Your vehicle has 4 seating positions, 2 in the front and 2 in the rear for total seating capacity of 4. Each seating position has a safety belt.

When approaching a vehicle driving ahead, the adaptive cruise control system automatically brakes to match that vehicle's speed and then maintains the set distance. As soon as the system does not detect a vehicle driving ahead, adaptive cruise control accelerates up to the stored speed.

2017,Audi,TT Coupe,PDF,2017 Audi TT Coupe — Owner's Manual,"You should rarely travel at the maximum vehicle speed. High speeds cause a disproportionately high increase in fuel consumption, emissions, and traffic noise. Slower driving saves fuel. Reduce idling time It pays off to stop the engine, for example, when at railroad crossings or traffic lights with longer red lights.

Stopping the engine for 30 - 40 seconds already saves more fuel than the amount of extra fuel needed to restart the engine. It takes a very long time in idle to warm the engine up to operating temperature. Wear and emissions are especially high in the warm-up phase. Therefore, you should begin driving immediately after starting the engine.

Avoid high RPMs while doing this. By having maintenance performed regularly on your vehicle, you can help to reduce fuel consumption before you even start to drive. The maintenance condition of your vehicle not only affects traffic safety and long-term value but also impacts fuel consumption. A poorly maintained engine can lead to fuel consumption that is 10% higher than normal.

Also, check the oil level when refueling. The oil consumption depends largely on the engine load and speed. It is normal for the oil consumption of a new engine to reach its lowest point only after a certain amount of use. Therefore, the oil consumption can only be properly judged after approximately 3,000 mi (S,000 km) have been driven.

The engine and exhaust cleaning system must reach their optimal operating temperature to effectively reduce consumption and emissions. A cold engine uses a disproportionately high amount of fuel. The engine reaches operating temperature and consumption normalizes only after approximately four kilometers.",https://ownersmanuals2.com/d/71993
2016,Audi,TT Coupe,PDF,2016 Audi TT Coupe — Owner's Manual,"The amount of fuel consumption, the environmental impact and the wear to the engine, brakes and tires depends mostly on your driving style. With an anticipatory and economic driving style, fuel consumption can be reduced by approximately 10-15%. The following tips will help you conserve the environment and your money at the same time. A vehicle uses the most fuel when accelerating.

When you drive with anticipation, you do not need to brake as often and thus accelerate less. When possible, let your vehicle coast with a gear engaged - for example, when you notice that the next traffic light is red. You should rarely travel at the maximum vehicle speed. High speeds cause a disproportionately high increase in fuel consumption, emissions and traffic noise.

2016,Audi,TT Roadster,PDF,2016 Audi TT Roadster — Owner's Manual,"New brake pads do not achieve their full braking effect during the first 250 mi (400 km). They must be ""broken in"" first. However, you can compensate for the slightly reduced braking force by pressing firmly on the brake pedal. Avoid heavy braking during the break-in period.

Brake pad wear depends largely on the way the vehicle is driven and on operating conditions. This is especially true if you are driving frequently in the city and on curves or with a sporty driving style. Noises may occur when braking depending on the speed, braking force and outside conditions such as temperature and humidity. In certain situations, for example after driving through water, in heavy rain, after overnight condensation or after washing your car, the braking effect can be reduced by moisture or ice on the brake rotors and brake pads.

The brakes must be ""dried"" first with a few careful brake applications. At higher speeds and with the windshield wipers turned on, the brake pads press against the brake rotors for a short amount of time. This action which is not felt by the driver happens at regular intervals and facilitates a better reaction time for the brakes in wet weather. The braking effect can also be reduced if you are driving on salted roads and you do not apply the brakes for long periods of time.

The layer of salt on the brake rotors and pads must be worn off first when the brakes are applied.",https://ownersmanuals2.com/d/65202

When the system detects a malfunction, the telltale will flash for approximately one minute and then remain continuously illuminated. This sequence will continue upon subsequent vehicle starts up as long as the malfunction exists.

When the malfunction indicator is illuminated, the system may not be able to detect or signal low tire pressure as intended. TPMS malfunctions may occur for a variety of reasons, including the installation of replacement or alternate tires or wheels on the vehicle that prevents the TPMS from functioning properly. Always check the TPMS malfunction telltale after replacing one or more tires or wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the replacement or alternate tires and wheels allow the TPMS to continue to function properly.
